# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
#
# what is != and where should you use it?
# put ! before something, like !user_name
# put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# put ? before something
# put ? after something
# put !! before something, like !!user_name

# 1. != means not equals
# 2. putting ! before something turns it into its opposite boolean equivalent
# 3. putting ! after something doesn't mean anything in Ruby syntax. But is used as a convention (not always) to indicate that a method is mutating its caller
# 4. 
# 5. putting ? after something also doesn't mean anything in Ruby syntax.
# 6. putting !! before something turns it into its boolean equivalent
