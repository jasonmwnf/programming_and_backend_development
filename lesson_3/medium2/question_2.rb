# Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block.
#
# Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous practice problem and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all of our outer variables.
#
# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."

  # This works the same as question_1. d_outer has the same id as a_outer. Ruby re-uses id's when the value is the same.

  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)


  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."

#   Wow, look at that. Even though we changed the values of our "outer" variables inside the method call, we still have the same values and the same object id's down here AFTER the method call as we had before it!
#
# This is because our method call accepts VALUES as parameters. The names we give to those values in the definition of our method are SEPARATE from any other use of those same names.
#
# We used the same names there for convenience (and admittedly to build some suspense and allow us to clarify this point). We could just as easily have called the first parameter of our method definition a_Fred instead of a_outer.
#
# The method gets the VALUES of the parameters we pass, but the parameter variables inside the method have no other relationship to those outside of the method. The names were coincidental, and confusing in a useful way.
