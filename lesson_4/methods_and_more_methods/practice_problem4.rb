# What is the return value of each_with_object in the following code? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'cat'].each_with_object({}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value[0]] = value
end

# => { "a" => "ant", "b" => "bear", "c" => "cat" }

# Based on our knowledge of each, it might be reasonable to think that each_with_object returns the original collection. That isn't the case, though. When we invoke each_with_object, we pass in an object ({} here) as an argument. That object is then passed into the block and it's updated value is returned at the end of each iteration. Once each_with_object has iterated over the calling collection, it returns the initially given object, which now contains all of the updates.
#
# In this code, we start with the hash object, {}. On the first iteration, we add "a" => "ant" to the hash. On the second, we add "b" => "bear", and on the last iteration, we add "c" => "cat". Thus, #each_with_object in this example returns a hash with those 3 elements.
