# How does take work? Is it destructive? How can we find out?

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.take(2)

# If you're unsure of how a method works the best thing to do is to read its documentation. Along with that, testing the method in irb can be very helpful. In this case we can quickly check if take is destructive or not by running the code in irb.
#
# irb :001 > arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# irb :002 > arr.take(2)
# => [1, 2]
# irb :003 > arr
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# By reading the docs and testing the method in irb, we're able to determine that Array#take selects a specified number of elements from an array. We're also able to verify that it isn't a destructive method.
